Some notes to help jog the memory...

- CSS Animations
    note: need to add rules seperatly for differant browsers
    add @-webkit- rule, and as another line of code wherever mentioned.
    @keyframes fadeBounce {
        0% {
            opacitiy: 0;
            transform: translateY(-200%);
        }
        55% {
            transform: translateY(-6px);
        }
        70% {
            transform: translateY(0);
        }
        85% {
            transform: translateY(-3px)
        }
        100% {
            opacitiy: 1;
            Transform: translateY(0);
        }
    }
--> Add the below to the applicable class
    .class{
        opacitiy: 0;
        animation-name: fadeBounce;
        animation-duration: 1s;
        animation-fill-mode: forwards;

-- Practice using screen size overrides for devices:
    @media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
        .appropriate class here {
            padding-left: 20px;
            padding-right: 20px;
        }

    }
---> These come after the elements in question within the style sheet
---> Adjust the browser to be about the size of the screen you are working on
---> Style for both 700px (tablet) and 480px (smartphone) screen size
---> Can also style for very large screens as well using (min-width: 1300px) 
-----> remember to increase the defualt font size for a larger screen
